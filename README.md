For this code to work necessary programs:  
	MATLAB installed (2015a or later) - including parallel toolbox  
	c compiler compatible with MATLAB for the compilation of mex files  
	Standalone c compiler for the compilation of console programs  
	fortran (90+) compiler for compilation of flow solvers   
	Cygwin needed for compilation of some flow solver features(Mesh motion) on windows with the "make" utility  

	


### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is the MATLAB implementation of the 2D R-Snake Volume of Solid (RSVS) parameterisation.
It includes an optimisation framework designed for to explore generic optimisation problems using this parameterisation.
A number of objective functions are included

### How do I get set up? ###

To get started:
(Linux - First Time) 
	Run: ./Result_Template/Source/CompileAll.sh
		This compiles all the separate utilities (mesher, flow solver, mesh deformation)
		requires fortran and c compilers
	Launch Matlab from the source directory
	in matlab:
		>> InitialiseSnakeFlow
		>> Compile_Mex
		>> ExecInclude

		
(Linux) If the distro contains all the necessary program and utilities this is designed to deply the code from a zipped git repo

	mv deploylinux.sh ../
	cd ..
	deploylinux.sh <source directory name>
		
(Windows) 
	Run: ./Result_Template/Source/CompileAllWin.sh
	
This compiles all the separate utilities (mesher, flow solver, mesh deformation)
	requires fortran and c compilers. Requires cygwin with the make tool.
	Launch Matlab from the source directory
	in matlab:
	
		>> InitialiseSnakeFlow
		>> Compile_Mex
		>> ExecInclude

(Any - At the start of a new MATLAB session) 
	in matlab:
	
		>> InitialiseSnakeFlow
		>> ExecInclude
		
Tests to run:
	Main('SnakesFoilVVSmall4')
	% Tests the Snaking process on a multi-topology case
	ExecuteOptimisation('Test_Rosenbrock')
	% Tests the optimisation framework on an analytical function
	
These tests will save results in:

	../results/Standard_Execution/<Archive_YYYY_MM>/Day_YY_MM_DD/
	

	and
	
	../results/Optimisation/<Archive_YYYY_MM>/Day_YY_MM_DD/
	
respectively. All result files and folders are time stamped such that a named sort will return the files in chronological order of creation.
These files and their location are entered into a file  at:
	../results/<archive_name>/Index_<archive_name>.txt

### Outline of the code ###

The code is centred around an optimisation framework executed through the function `ExecuteOptimisation`
This framework was developped to exploit the RSVS which is implemented in function `Snakes` and executed through function `Main`


ExecuteOptimisation can accept a minimum of 1 input and up to 3.
	In normal execution only the first input is required. It must be the name of a function stored as a string.
	This function must return a valid parameter structure in the form of those generated by StructOptimParam.
	In practice new parameter configurations are added as local functions to StructOptimParam.m
	A example is below:
	
		function [paroptim]=<function_name_callable_string>()
			% With parameter structure with default settings
			[paroptim]=DefaultOptim(); 
			% Apply a Standard modification to default settings: for example change all the 
			% settings required to change the optimiser for aero, differential evolution cases:
			paroptim=CutCellObjective(paroptim);
			paroptim=OptimDE(paroptim);
			
			% Single changes to specific parameters:
			paroptim.general.maxIter=5; % maximum number of optimisation iteration
			paroptim.general.worker=2; % number of parallel worker
		end


Input 2 of ExecuteOptimisation is a cell array used to restart an optimisation. The form of this is:
{'path_to_restart_data.mat',{'optim_type',isRestart}}

'path_to_restart_data.mat' is the path to the matlab data where the restart information is stored. The strict
		minimum  is for this to contain the result structure from the optimisation process called `optimstruct`
		(Saved in OptimRes_<...>.mat in the result directory)
		
'optim_type' is the type of optimisation that was used as a string usually either 'conjgrad' or 'DE'

isRestart stores whether a gradient based optimisation should be restarted from a Line search (0) or a gradient calculation (1)
	in general mod(numel(optimstruct)+1,2) will give you the right answer for gradient based optimisation. Always 1 for DE.
